#### How to get started working on this repo

1. Open Github desktop, sign in if necessary
2. Click file > clone repository, click this repo if it's there (it should be)
3. This will clone the current repo on github into a folder on your computer
4. In the repo directory run `npm install http-errors express cookie-parser morgan debug`, then `npm install hbs` then `npm audit fix`
4. Get working on your own version. Push it to either danu or localhost to test out stuff (port is 8673 by default)
5. Once you're happy with your changes you can make a commit, add a nice descriptive message and push  to origin.
